    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When the body of a function contains one or more occurrences of the keyword **yield**, the function is named a \"**generator**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When a generator is called, the function body does not execute. Instead, calling the generator returns a special **iterator** object that wraps the function body, the set of its local variables (including its parameters), and the current point of execution, which is initially the start of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the **next()** method of this iterator object is called, the function body executes up to the next **`yield`** statement, which takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`yield expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a `yield` statement executes, the function is frozen with its execution state and local variables intact, and the expression following `yield` is returned as the result of the `next()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next call to `next()`,execution of the function body resumes where it left off, again up to the next `yield` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function body ends or executes a `return` statement, the iterator raises a `StopIteration` to indicate that the iterator is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: return statements in a generator cannot contain expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to use an iterator is to loop on it with a `for` statement, you typically call a generator in the same way:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for avariable in somegenerator(arguments):`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a generator that works somewhat like the built-in `range()` function, but returns a sequence of floating-point values instead of a sequence of integers:"

    "## Generator as co-routines\n",
    "\n",
    "In languages that provide for generators, an important feature is the ability to pass a value back into the generator. This allows for supporting a programming feature called **coroutines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the generators more powerful, the designers of Python have added in Python 2.5 the ability to pass data back into the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ve seen that generators allow us to pull data and pause execution from a function context. Coroutines allow us to push data. In this case, the `yield` statement basically means \"Wait until you get some input data\". \n",
    "\n",
    "If, from the perspective of the generator, you think of the `yield` as calling something, then the concept is easy; you just save the results of yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "`result = yield`\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the caller of the generator, this statement returns control back to the caller, just as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the generator, when the execution comes back into the generator, a value will come with it (in this case, the generator saves it into the variable `result`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where does the value come from? The caller must call a method called **`send()`** to pass a value back into the generator. The method `send()` behaves just like the method `next()`, except that it passes a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do this, however, we must first ***prime*** the coroutine with a call to either `send(None)` or `__next__()`: a coroutine can't receive a value right away; it must first run through all its code leading up to its first `yield`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with a generator, a coroutine is finished when it either reaches the end of its normal execution flow, or when it hits a return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator objects also have a **`close()`** method (new in Python 2.5). This method frees up the resources for the generator and finishes the coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call `next()` or `send()` again after calling `close()`, you'll get a `StopIteration` exception.\n"
