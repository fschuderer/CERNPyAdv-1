    "# Context managers and the with statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`with`** statement in Python is a useful construct for properly managing external resources in your programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to take advantage of **context managers** to automatically handle the setup and teardown phases whenever you’re dealing with external resources or with operations that require those phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use two general approaches to deal with resource management. You can wrap your code in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) A try … finally construct\n",
    "    2) A with construct\n",
    "    \n",
    "The second approach provides a straightforward way to use setup and teardown code, but you’ll have the limitation that the **`with`** statement only works with **context managers**. "

    "\n",
    "If `open` itself raises an exception, the file is not opened and does not need to be closed. \n",

    "## The with Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python **`with`** statement creates a runtime context that is used to run a group of statements under the control of a **context manager**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to traditional `try … finally` constructs, the `with` statement can make your code clearer, safer, and more reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a **with** statement, you need to use the following general syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`with expression as var:\n",
    "    # do something with var`\n",
    "\t\n",
    "The expression after `with` must return a ***context manager object***, i.e. an object that implements the ***context management protocol***. \n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol consists of two special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`__enter__()`** is called by the with statement to enter the runtime context. `__enter__()`, typically provides the setup code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__exit__()`** is called when the execution leaves the with code block. `__exit__()` typically provides the teardown logic or cleanup code, such as calling `close()` on an open file object.\n",
    "The `__exit__()` method takes 3 arguments (`exc_type`, `exc_val` , `exc_tb`). These are used to pass information about a potential exception that could happen within the `with` statements.\n",
    "When there’s an exception if the `__exit__()` method returns `True` then that means it has been handled so it is not raised. If it returns anything else then it is raised by `with`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`as`** specifier is optional. If you provide a ***`var`*** with **`as`**, then the value returned from the invocation of the special method `__enter__()` is bound to that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Some context managers return `None` from `__enter__()` because they have no useful object to give back to the caller. In these cases, specifying a var makes no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the **`with`** statement proceeds when Python runs into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `with` statement calls expression to obtain a context manager.\n",
    "- The `with` statement calls `__enter__()` on the context manager and bind its return value to `var` if provided.\n",
    "- The `with` statement executes the `with` code block.\n",
    "- The `with` statement calls `__exit__()` on the context manager when the `with` code block finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous file example can be implemented like that:"
