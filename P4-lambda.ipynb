    "## Syntax of Lambda Function in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a lambda function is just like any normal python function, except that it has no name when defining it, and its definition is limited to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "`lambda arguments: expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one `expression`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `expression` is evaluated and returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "- Lambdas can be used for simple logical operations that are easy to understand, they make the code more readable.\n",
    "- Lambdas can be used when you need a function that you will use just one time.\n",
    "- Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition:\n",
    "`(lambda a: a**3)(3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "- Lambdas can only perform one expression. It’s not possible to have multiple independent operations in one lambda function.\n",
    "- Lambdas cannot have a doc-string to explain all the inputs, operations, and outputs as you would in a normal def function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Internally, both `lambda` and `def` functions works exactly the same (same bytecode)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Lambda functions accept all kinds of arguments, just like normal `def` function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of Lambda Function in python\n",
    "\n",
    "We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we generally use it as an argument to a ***higher-order function*** (a function that takes in other functions as arguments). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like **`filter()`**, **`map()`** **`reduce`**, ... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "**`filter()`** is a builtin function that takes as argument a function and an iterable object and it returns only those values that fit certain criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`filter(function, iterable)` \n",
    "\n",
    "The `function` is called with all the items in the `iterable` and the elements for which the function evaluates to `True` are returned (filter is act as a generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we can extract out of a tuple of numbers the even numbers using a lambda function.\n"
