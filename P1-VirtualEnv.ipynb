    "## What Is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of Python ***virtual environments*** is to create an isolated environment for Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our little example above, we just need to create a separate virtual environment for both `ScriptA` and `ScriptB`: each environment would be able to depend on whatever version of `Module1` they choose, independent of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are just directories containing a few scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are easily created using the **virtualenv** or **pyenv** command line tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no limits to the number of environments you can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 comes with the **venv** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the step needed to create a virtual environment using this module\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Start by making a new directory to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "$ mkdir my_first_env\n",
    "$ cd my_first_env\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Create a new virtual environment inside the directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ python -m venv env (or python3 -m venv env)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, this command creates a directory called `env`, which contains the sub-directories `bin` (or `Scripts`), `include` (or `Include`) and `lib` (or `Lib`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: By default, this new `env` will not include any of your existing custom `site packages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what each folder contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`bin`** (linux, MacOS) or **`Scripts`** (Win): files that interact with the virtual environment\n",
    "- **`include`**: C headers that compile the Python packages\n",
    "- **`lib`**: a copy of the Python version along with a site-packages folder where each dependency is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a virtual environment has been created, it can be \"**activated**\" using a script (**`activate`**) located in the virtual environment’s `bin` (or `Script`) directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The invocation of the script is platform-specific:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "$ cd my_first_env\n",
    "$ source myenv\\Scripts\\activate (on Win)\n",
    "$ source myenv/bin/activate (on Linux or MacOS)\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: When a virtual environment is active, the **`VIRTUAL_ENV`** environment variable is set to the path of the virtual environment. This can be used to check if one is running inside a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deactivate a virtual environment by using the shell command **deactivate**.\n",

    "### How to customize a virtual environment with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Common installation tools such as `setuptools` or `pip` work as expected with virtual environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when a virtual environment is active, they install Python packages into the virtual environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` allows you to specify which version of a package to install using version specifiers. For example, to **install** a specific version of `requests`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m pip install requests==2.18.4`\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the latest 2.x release of requests:\n",

    "\n",
    "`python -m pip install --upgrade requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` can export a list of all installed packages and their versions using the **`freeze`** argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m pip freeze`\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will output a list of package specifiers like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cachetools==2.0.1\n",

    "**Requirements Files** are files containing a list of items to be installed using `pip install` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
